This means that we have to generate moves for the opponent, and check to see if at least one is legal. The problem occurs when we find a legal move and apply it to the board, because applyMove will update the state again. This is unnecessary and should be circumvented - once validMove returns true, we are done.",Bug,Beta,,closed,ericmostReturning captured pieces in ChessBoard creates impossible downcast,"On line 84 of ChessBoard.java, there is a bug when trying to cast an arraylist to an array.  Explination is in the following FindBugs report:Bug: Impossible downcast of toArray() result to com.bubblechess.client.BoardPiece[] in com.bubblechess.client.ChessBoard.getCaptured()This code is casting the result of calling toArray() on a collection to a type more specific than Object[], as in:```String[] getAsArray(Collection<String> c) {  return (String[]) c.toArray();  }```This will usually fail by throwing a ClassCastException. The toArray() of almost all collections return an Object[]. They can't really do anything else, since the Collection object has no reference to the declared generic type of the collection. The correct way to do get an array of a specific type from a collection is to use c.toArray(new String[]); or c.toArray(new String[c.size()]); (the latter is slightly more efficient). There is one common/known exception exception to this. The toArray() method of lists returned by Arrays.asList(...) will return a covariantly typed array. For example, Arrays.asArray(new String[] { ""a"" }).toArray() will return a String []. FindBugs attempts to detect and suppress such cases, but may miss some. Rank: Scary (5), confidence: HighPattern: BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY Type: BC, Category: CORRECTNESS (Correctness)",Bug,Beta,,closed,markkohdevImplemented Board Pieces mask field in superclass (ChessPiece),"Severity: Low priorityIn the implementation of each BoardPiece, the overridden directional vector (`dirs`) masks the vector created in the superclass.
